# From MI - need to revise
fastq_file can be compressed or uncompressed. It MUST have this name format: Sample-readlength.fq
Only underscores (\"_\") are allowed in the Sample name. No dashes, dots, spaces, etc.
If running with the paired end option (\"\-PE\"), they must be called: Sample_1-length.fq Sample_2-length.fq
The process can be started with \"genome substracted\" samples if a Sample-lenght-e.fq is used
Species implemented: Human (hg19) or Mouse (mm9)
For expression analyses: -expr (PSIs plus cRPKM calculations) OR -exprONLY (only cRPKMs) OR none
For trimming, it can be trimmed once (at 3') or twice (in an overlapping manner).
If nothing is provided, the program will decide based on the length of the reads (Default is twice if length>50)
-c N: Number of threds used when running bowtie (default=1).
Recommended to allow at least 15GB of RAM (~10GB are needed for mapping to the genome). For large files (~1 lane), >25GB
