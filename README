VAST-TOOLS
==========

Summary
-------
VAST-TOOLS is a toolset for profiling alternative splicing events in RNA-Seq data. 

Installation
------------

VAST requires the following software:
    * bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009), http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml
    * samtools (Li et al., 2009), http://samtools.sourceforge.net

Optional software:
    * pigz - a parallel implementation of gzip, http://zlib.net/pigz/

If pigz is installed, VAST will use the user-specified number of cores
(see usage) to carry out file compression. This will help speed up the runtime.

Quick Usage
-----------

vast-tools align input1.fq.gz -readLen 158 -o outputdir
vast-tools align input2.fq.gz -readLen 158 -o outputdir

vast-tools combine -o outputdir

vast-tools diff -a sampleA_rep1@sampleA_rep2 -b sampleB_rep1@sampleB_rep2 -o outputdir --filter > significant_events.tab

vast-tools plot significant_events.tab

**Alignment:**
# From MI - need to revise
fastq_file can be compressed or uncompressed. It MUST have this name format: Sample-readlength.fq
Only underscores (\"_\") are allowed in the Sample name. No dashes, dots, spaces, etc.
If running with the paired end option (\"\-PE\"), they must be called: Sample_1-length.fq Sample_2-length.fq
The process can be started with \"genome substracted\" samples if a Sample-lenght-e.fq is used
Species implemented: Human (hg19) or Mouse (mm9)
For expression analyses: -expr (PSIs plus cRPKM calculations) OR -exprONLY (only cRPKMs) OR none
For trimming, it can be trimmed once (at 3') or twice (in an overlapping manner).
If nothing is provided, the program will decide based on the length of the reads (Default is twice if length>50)
-c N: Number of threds used when running bowtie (default=1).
Recommended to allow at least 15GB of RAM (~10GB are needed for mapping to the genome). For large files (~1 lane), >25GB
###

**Combining Results:**

**Differential Splicing Analysis**

**Plotting:**

VAST comes with some basic plotting scripts written in R. The scripts can be found
in the 'plot' subdirectory. To execute from VAST, use the subcommand "plot".

e.g.

> vast-tools plot psi_values.tab

The input format follows the same format from the "combine" step described
above. The output is a pdf of scatterplots (one per AS event) of PSI values. It
is recommended to filter the input file to a subset of events of interest before
using this plotting function. Otherwise, the resulting pdf file will be very
large.
